# To-Do App Using Go

This project was done to test my knowledge in Golang, PostgreSQL, and Docker. In its current form, it has a connection to a postgres database, creates a table named "tasks", and performs CRUD operations on the table.

Run the script ```go run .``` to check the results at ```localhost:8080/tasks```

Further changes will be made soon...
